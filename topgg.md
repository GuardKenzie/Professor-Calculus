# Features
Here is a summary of what I can do.

## Events
My main feature is my event funtion. I keep an organised list of all scheduled events along with all essential information like 
1. Event date and time
2. Event description
3. A list of people attending
4. Custom roles (emojis) for people to pick when signing up

Event scheduling is fully interactive and very simple.

 Events can be scheduled as a one time thing or a recurring weekly event. When an event is recurring, the bot will post a little friendly reminder in the morning of the day the event is set to take place.

 If an event has been set up with roles, the attend command will give users a choice between those available.

## Lo-fi radio
The bot can also join your voice channel and start playing some chill tunes from a 24/7 lo-fi radio station.
